### Pillars of System Design

### Good design:

- Scalability
- Reliability
- Maintainability 
- Efficiency


### 3 key elements of judging a system:

1. Moving Data
2. Storing Data
3. Data transformation



CAP theorem: Design requirements; according to which every design solution can only satisfy two of these.

1. CONSISTENCY: If 1 place we have changed a common value being used in other table, it should be changed throughout the DB
2. AVAILABILITY: System being up and running and no down time

3. PARTITION TOLERANCE: If one service/ instance goes down the app is still working
